                            <p> The Android Security Team regularly receives requests for information about preventing potential security issues on Android devices. We also occasionally spot check devices and let device manufacturers and affected partners know of potential issues. Java is set nicely and it works. It's the problem with the ANDROID_SDK_HOME variable. How can I set that variable? You gave me that link but they never explain what it actually means to set the environment variable. Hi, Since I'm limited to only 4GB on AppData I wanted to move the 2GB od HS data to my storage part of my phone memory. My phone is rooted but I don't have a SD card slot so I can only use the fat32 partition of my internal memory (where I have 16GB free). I've trying symlinking the DATA folder manually but HS crashes at start. Same goes for any application that does the same (FolderMount, etc.) I have Link2SD premium and I can move a part of the app to my storage partition

Hello, I was curious what do you all think of Wix's navigator? Do you like it, would you recommend using. I want to make a symbolic link in Linux. I have written this bash command where the first path is the folder I want link into and the second path is the compiled source. All you need is an unlocked bootloader and the latest TWRP recovery (I confirmed this works perfectly on the US Nexus 6 on Verizon). Boot into recovery~~, go to advanced,~~ and click 'mount' and select system. Plug your phone into your computer and open terminal/cmd run the following: gtadb pull /system/build.prop This will pull the build.prop onto your computer in the location where your terminal is open. Edit that in your favorite text editor on your compute.

Hello, I'm considering purchasing the Samsung Chromebook Plus when it gets released and I don't to get anything wrong considering I live in the EU and will be importing it from the USA shall I decide to make this purchase. What finally pushed to towards purchasing a Chromebook is Android Apps and Play Store availability. However, as I understand, the only folder Chrome OS and Android actually have in common and can both access in the Downloads folder, which means no access to microSD card. According to Google, phones that are capable of running ICS (Android 4.0) can run Jelly Bean too. Same is the case with Sony Xperia Ray ST18i which has 1 GHz single core processor & already got official ICS firmware update If i format my internal sd card to ntfs will i be able to create symlinks from /data to the sd card since the ntfs supports symlinks? Will i have any issues if i convert my sd card from vfat to ntfs? I have android 4.4.2 on my device. If there's docs on it, I'll take that. Any web searches for "symlink" "symbolic link" "windows 10 " "powershell" returns everything except the base command. Even the powershell docs site returns. So I am loving my RetroPie (4.x on Pi 3) But it made me want to deploy more of them in other rooms in my house. Copying a ROM collection, with scraping, etc to every Pi could be a bit of a PITA. So I am going to test (haven't done it yet), relocating the ROMs folder to my Ubuntu server and just mounting the folder over NFS. But that got me wondering, is there something out there that would allow the same thing to work over http/https? This would allow you to point almost any number. 
After updating SIF on two devices last night, I had the sour displeasure of noticing that reading/writing to/from the SD card is no longer working. Almost at all. ampnbsp; I had a setup where both `files/` and `shared_prefs/` were mounted on the SD card, to save space on the internal storage, and it worked fine for about a year or so (and still works on EN). After last update it stopped working and the initial bootstrap update (the one with the black background) would be stuck at 0/100 By cached library, I mean when you upload to Google Music for PC and download to your device. I really want xposed back with most modules, but I dont want to download 10 gigs of music. Thanks in advance. Anybody has any updates or news about Debian for ARM? I am quite tired of a buggy Android smartphone. I've made an extremely simple and simple-minded D2EXT method, it's called INT2SD and I'm implementing it into Desire ROMs (since that's the only Android phone I own). It's achieved by simply editing the init.rc to mount sd-ext to /data instead of mounting the userdata MTD partition to /data. I believe it can give significant speed improvements as opposed to other D2EXT methods featuring bind mounts and symlinks. I'm implementing it into Sense ROMs as well, since the /system partition As requested by some, crossposting of my post in r/Android: -- At some point in time, Linux users/devs were fed up with the constant cluttering of their home-folder, that they created the XDG basedir spec 0  While on the desktop/notebook I can live with the mess that are dotfiles, since by default all major filemanager hide them from your view until requested, I can not live with this on my phones "sd-card". I usually don't mess with your files in your apps data-dir, so go crazy there, please.

Hi C_Programming, I normally hang out in /r/androiddev, but I've run into some fun problems and I thought you guys might help. I've recently been trying to cross compile libFLAC for Android. I've managed to set things up and gotten what I believe to be a solid libFLAC.so, compiled for arm out of the build process. My question relates to the version numbers appended to the (three) different so files that I get. One is so, one is so.8 and one is so.8.3.0 something very similar. My unders. So I have a Desire and its dreadful available memory problem which I'm trying to circumvent through different options. I went the CM7.1 way, which helped, app2SD, which helped some more but just recently, with the barrage of bargain applications I'm constantly low on space. So I repartitioned the SD, added an ext3 primary partition and started using Link2SD. The problem is that, even though Link2SD actually moves the app to the ext3 partition and correctly links it from the app partition I'm not an Android developer, so there very well be an obvious technical limitation preventing this. In addition, my assumption about how these applications detect root may very well be wrong. I keep reading about applications that refuse to work correctly if you're rooted. I assume these applications know you're rooted by checking for the presence of /system/bin/su. Is this the case? If so, why isn't there an app which chroots each application and prevents them from having visibility 
I have the T-Mobile HTC One m8, 4.4.4 Sorry to bother you for this. The current software (HTC sense) on the device is 3.12.405.1 while the newest software should be 3.13.161.5. Clicking the check for software update button does not help. I can't seem to be able to update it. Also. If there is a good guide on rooting it and putting stock Android 4.1 on it, I would be very grateful if someone could So I'm interested in dropping Dropbox because I have a dinky little server sitting in my basement with 3 TB of hard drive space, and it's not doing much. It's just a backup server right now, though it could be much more. I have two computers that currently interface with my Dropbox: my personal laptop, and my work box. There's also my Android phone. I'm currently using Dropbox Pro, with 100GB. I synchronize a great many folders using symlinks inside the Dropbox directory that point Is the MicroSD card mainly for holding movie and music files? I was hoping to get one to save apps to or allow for additional 'internal' memory, but it appears there is a difference with what can be saved and accessed on a MicroSD compared to actual internal memory. What do you use your MicroSDs.
